## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated sky blue (#95bde3) to promote focus without eye strain.
- Background color: Light grey (#f0f0f0) in light mode, and a dark grey (#333333) in dark mode, providing comfortable contrast and readability.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#a292ba) as an analogous color to sky blue, but slightly darker and more saturated, will provide the impression of elegance and call attention to important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'JetBrains Mono' for displaying code snippets.
- Subtle animations on interactions (button presses, transitions) to enhance UX.
